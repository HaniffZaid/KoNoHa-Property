### **Known Quirks & Quibbles**

**Quirk #1: Data Drama**

- *What’s Up* : Our data’s got a mind of its own—especially in the Location and Property Type columns. It’s a bit all over the place.
- *How to Handle It*: Before you run our scripts, give those columns a little TLC and make sure they’re consistent.
- *We’re On It* : We’re cooking up a script to handle this automatically, so stay tuned!

**Quirk #2: The Overfitting Fiasco**

- *What’s Up* : Our model sometimes gets a little too cozy with small datasets, which isn’t great for generalizing.
- *How to Handle It* : Try out cross-validation or sprinkle in some regularization to keep things on track.

> We’re On It: We’re exploring new methods to toughen up our model, so hang tight for improvements.
Check back here for updates—we’re always working on making things better!
